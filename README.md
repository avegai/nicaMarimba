# Introducing: nicaMarimba!

This is a small website/playground to showcase a bit of the history/background and possibilities of the Nicaraguan Marimba. 

There are two theories about the marimba’s origins—one a whisper from the past, the other a tale carried by the tides of history.
		Some say its roots stretch deep into the pre-Columbian earth, born from the hands of Mesoamerican indigenous artisans who shaped wood into something timeless. Others believe it arrived from across the Atlantic ocean, brought by enslaved Africans who carried their rhythms, their sorrow, and their spirit into the heart of the Americas.
		The Nicaraguan marimba, at first glance, resembles its Guatemalan or Colombian cousins, yet its voice is distinct—richer, earthier, and touched with an unmistakable crunch. This raw edge comes from gourd resonators textured by membranes crafted from pig intestines—a detail that gives the instrument its signature bite.
		I had the privilege of working with two extraordinary marimba players from Nicaragua’s new generation: Carlos Luis Mejía and Evenor González. Each has pushed the instrument’s limits while remaining faithful to its soul—Mejía with La Cuneta Son Machín, González with Momotombo.
		When capturing these sounds, we dug deep into ancestral riffs, looping motifs, and age-old rhythms, honoring the past while allowing the marimba to breathe, to evolve—to sing in a language as old as the land itself.
