# Introducing: nicaMarimba!

This is a small website/playground to showcase a bit of the history/background and possibilities of the Nicaraguan Marimba. 

# Instructions:

Keyboard control:

1. A thru L (C to C) trigger single notes, so you can basically play the marimba as a piano.
2. 1-4 triggers experimental samples
3. 5-8 activates effects, reverses and processes the aforementioned samples in different ways, try it out!
4. Mouse clicks trigger a nice crunchy effect on the percussion

This is still a WIP as of 8.1.25
